# FinReason

A Large Dataset for Reason Extraction of Structural Events from Financial Documents


## Description

FinReason is a financial-domain Chinese corpus regarding extracting the causes of major
events in the announcements of listed companies. Each document in this corpus contains one or more structural events, and each event has none, one or more causes in the document. These events are automatically matching to the documents and the causes are manually annotated. In total, there are 3 types of events in FinReason. 

* Pledge: Pledging of shares is that the shareholders of listed companies use their stocks

* O&U: Overweighting\Underweighting of shares refers to the major shareholder's increasing
or reducing of their shares over the company. This kind of event indicates the confidence of the major shareholders towards the company and will have an influence on the stock price.
